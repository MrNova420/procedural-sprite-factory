# 🎨 Procedural Sprite Factory

**An algorithmic 2D asset foundry that generates infinite pixel art sprites, animations, and effects using pure mathematics.**

Not AI. Not hand-drawn. **Pure procedural generation.**

---

## ✨ What It Does

Input DNA → Output complete game-ready sprites with animations

```javascript
generate({
  species: "dragon",
  style: "dark-fantasy",
  size: 2.5
})
```

Results in:
- High-quality pixel art sprite (32x32 to 128x128)
- Complete animation set (idle, walk, attack, die)
- Visual effects (fire breath, wing flaps, glows)
- Infinite unique variations
- Export-ready PNG/sprite sheets

---

## 🎯 Current Status

**Phase 1**: Foundation + Core Engine ✅ IN PROGRESS

- [x] Project architecture designed
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Core engine framework
- [ ] Basic shape generation
- [ ] Simple export system

**Next**: Shape Engine → Texture Brain → DNA System

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## 🏗️ Architecture

5 Core Engines working together:

1. **Shape Engine** - Pixel-perfect geometry and skeletons
2. **Texture Brain** - Procedural material generation
3. **Style Engine** - Art direction and aesthetics
4. **DNA Generator** - Infinite variation system
5. **Animation + VFX** - Motion and particle effects

---

## 🎨 Features (Planned)

- ✅ Infinite unique sprites
- ✅ 10+ species types
- ✅ 20+ art styles
- ✅ Skeletal animation
- ✅ Particle effects
- ✅ Batch generation
- ✅ Evolution system
- ✅ Export to PNG/sprite sheets

---

## 🛠️ Technology

- Node.js + Express
- HTML5 Canvas
- Simplex Noise (procedural textures)
- Pure JavaScript (no frameworks)
